    "I will look up recreational venues in each neighborhood of the city using the Foursquare \"Search for Venues\" API, and then make a specific API call for each venue to \"Get a Venue's Hours.\" I will process the revieced data to get the mean hour of closure for venues in each neighborhood, and also by each type of venue in each neighborhood. I will then perform a cluster analysis of the data, by both total mean and per-type mean, in each neighborhood, and see what signifiance is produced. I will finally present the results on a choropleth map which will help each of the stakeholders answer their relevant questions."
